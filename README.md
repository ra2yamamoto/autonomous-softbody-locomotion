# autonomous-softbody-locomotion

For this project I used neuroevolution (via HyperNEAT) to train 2D simulated soft robots to move themselves. This project was submitted as a final project for Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, and Artificial Intelligence (DGMD S-17) taken at Harvard Summer School.

For an in-depth analysis of results and methods please see `Summary document.pdf` or the slides I used to present the project: https://www.canva.com/design/DAEmQGcDc0Y/3DOtTb4ORJw1ug4TR6_9bQ/view?utm_content=DAEmQGcDc0Y&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer.

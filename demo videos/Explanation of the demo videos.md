Explanation of the demo videos:

Most of these videos don't include voiceovers largely because I was planning on explaining them in real time during my presentation. Most of them are pretty self explanatory, but they can largely be broken into a few groups.

**Feed Forward model**

This was the first model I attempted, which consisted of using a feed forward neural network and no muscle grouping.

Videos include: `Feed forward model with no muscle groups`

**RNN model without muscle grouping**

This was the second model I attempted, where I used an RNN instead of a Feed Forward Network and still no muscle grouping.

Videos include: `Recurrent but no muscle groups`

**RNN model with muscle grouping and assorted experiments**

This was the third model I tried, which was finally successful. In this model I used an RNN as well as muscle grouping.

Videos include: `Recurrent model with muscle groups`, `Recurrent model with muscle groups 2`, `L Shaped Body`, `Longer Body Shape`, `Square shaped body`

**Other**

`Attempt at directional control` showcases my 16th try at implementing directional control with an additional "direction" input node to the RNN.

`Softbody demo.mov` shows me playing with a soft body as a demonstration.
